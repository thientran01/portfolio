    overview: 'FixMyBlock is a mobile application designed to empower residents to report and track neighborhood issues such as damaged infrastructure, safety concerns, and maintenance needs. The app connects residents directly with local authorities, streamlining the reporting process and improving response times.',
    challenge: 'Residents in urban neighborhoods often struggle to report local issues effectively. Traditional channels like phone calls and emails can be time-consuming and lack transparency in the resolution process. We needed to create a solution that would make reporting simple, trackable, and effective while encouraging community engagement.',
    solution: 'We designed a user-friendly mobile application that allows residents to quickly report issues with geo-location, photos, and descriptions. The app includes a tracking system that provides updates on the status of reported problems and notifies users when issues are resolved. A community feed shows nearby reports and allows residents to upvote priority concerns.',

    overview: 'Emotion Compass is a digital tool designed to help users develop greater emotional intelligence through guided self-reflection exercises, mood tracking, and personalized insights. The application supports users in identifying patterns in their emotional responses and developing healthier coping mechanisms.',
    challenge: 'Many people struggle to understand and process their emotions effectively, leading to poor decision-making, strained relationships, and mental health challenges. Traditional therapy is expensive and time-consuming, while most self-help apps lack personalization and scientific grounding. We needed to create an accessible tool that would help users develop emotional self-awareness in their daily lives.',
    solution: 'We designed an application that combines regular check-ins with guided reflection exercises and visualization tools that help users understand patterns in their emotional responses. The app uses a custom-designed "compass" visualization that maps emotional states and provides insights based on user data. Personalized recommendations help users develop coping strategies tailored to their emotional patterns.',
